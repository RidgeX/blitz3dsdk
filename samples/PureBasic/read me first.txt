********** Blitz3D SDK include file for PureBasic 4 **********

This is a very quick conversion of blitz3dsdk.h to blitz3dsdk.pbi!

IMPORTANT! Copy B3D.dll from the Blitz3D SDK's 'redist' folder into
this folder before trying to run the examples. (Alternatively, place it
in your system path, or use the SDK's installer program. You need to
distribute this DLL with any programs you create using the Blitz3D SDK.)

IMPORTANT! Note that Blitz3D's debug mode is enabled by default. For
full speed, and for release versions of your programs, make sure you
disable the debugger, by calling this line after bbBeginBlitz3D ():

	bbSetBlitz3DDebugMode (0)

Note that the Blitz3D library's debug mode is separate to PureBasic's
own debug mode!

BASIC

 To use the include file you need to place blitz3dsdk.pbi in the same
folder as your PB project, and add this line at the start:

	IncludeFile "blitz3dsdk.pbi"

 Call bbBeginBlitz3D () before any other Blitz3D functions;
 Call bbEndBlitz3D () before exiting your PB program.

 Just use integer variables for Blitz objects, eg.

	cam = bbCreateCamera ()
	bbMoveEntity (cam, 0, 0, -5)

PUREBASIC-specific

 The BBGraphics type is called _BBGraphics in the PureBasic version
as the function name causes a conflict with the type name in PB.
