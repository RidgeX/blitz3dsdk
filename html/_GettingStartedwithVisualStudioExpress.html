<p>
The Blitz3DSDK distribution contains files to work with both Microsoft's .Net 
managed languages including a C# definition file with embedded
quickhelp and C++ compatible library and header files. 
</p><p>
All Microsoft Visual Studio Express languages are currently free versions
of their professional products and with the addition of the Blitz3DSDK
provide an excellent introduction to industrial strength C++ and C#
development.

Begin by installing either the C++ or C# Express editions:

After installation begin by loading the example projects that are
included in the Blitz3DSDK distribution.

The C++ example requires it not be relocated from the sdk
without the ../lib and ../include folders being moved also.
