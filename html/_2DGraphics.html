<h1>2D Graphics</h1>
<p>
The Blitz3DSDK includes support for 2D graphics development
including the ability to draw text, shapes and display images 
in a variety of file formats in either a windowed or fullscreen
display.

The 2D commands in the following section can be used with 
a plain <a href=bbgraphics.html>bbGraphics</a> based display or a 3D display initialized 
with the <a href=bbgraphics3d.html>bbGraphics3D</a> command.
</p><p>
The advantages of using a plain <a href=bbgraphics.html>bbGraphics</a> display when 3D
graphics are not required includes being compatible with older 
generation computers that do not feature 3D accelerated 
graphics cards.
</p><p>
Other commands provided feature the ability to read and
write the pixel buffers of both display, image and texture
buffers.
</p><p>
Collision testing functions are provided that make testing for
overlapping images and rectangles easy.
