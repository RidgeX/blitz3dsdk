of generic operations that can be used with all entity types 
as well as those specific to certain types.

All entitity types have a 3D position, direction and scale
that is defined relative to their parent.

They all have a display state that can be switched on 
and off using the <a href=bbhideentity.html>bbHideEntity</a> and <a href=bbshowentity.html>bbShowEntity</a> commands.

interactive responses to either each other or rays fired by
the various pick methods provided.
