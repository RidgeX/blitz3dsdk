<h1>C# Programming </h1>
<p>
The simplest introduction to C# programming with the Blitz3DSDK
is to load and modify the examples provided in the VisualCSharp
folder.
</p><p>
To create a new project either copy and rename the example project
included or use the following steps.
</p><p>
Begin by creating a new empty project.
</p><p>
As the Blitz3DSDK is only distributed as a 32 bit DLL the configuration
manager must be used to make your new project an X86 Configuaration
so it knows to load the 32 bit dll even when running on 64 bit editions of 
Windows.
</p><p>
Run the Configuration Manager in the Visual Studio Build menu and 
select New Platform. Then for your new project select an X86 platform 
based on the default Any CPU configuration settings. Your application 
will now be compatible with the Blitz3DSDK environment on both 32 
and 64 bit Windows systems. 
</p><p>
Add New Item of type Code File. This creates a new C# source file
</p><p>
The following is a simple C# application featuring a rotating cube using the
Blitz3DSDK class defined in the blitz3dsdk.cs source file. You can copy 
it into your newly created code file or use it as reference.
</p><pre>using System;

using bb=Blitz3DSDK;

static class RotateCube{
	[STAThread]
	static void Main(){
		bb.BeginBlitz3D();
		bb.Graphics3D(960, 540, 0, 2);
		int cube = bb.CreateCube(0);
		int light = bb.CreateLight(1, 0);
		int camera = bb.CreateCamera(0);
		
		bb.PositionEntity(camera, 0, 0, -4, 1);
		
		while (bb.KeyHit(1)==0){
			bb.UpdateWorld(1);
			bb.RenderWorld(0);
			bb.TurnEntity(cube, .1f, .2f, .3f, 1);
			bb.Text(20, bb.GraphicsHeight() - 20, &quot;Blitz3DSDK C# Example&quot;, 0, 0);
			bb.Flip(1);
		}
		bb.EndBlitz3D();
	}
}
</pre><p>
Select Add Existing Item and navigate to the "include/blitz3dsdk.cs" file in the main Blitz3D SDK
folder. VisualStudio will then copy the file to the source folder of your new project. 
</p><p>
If the new project fails to build or run check that it's Application Properties are configured 
as Windows Application not Console Application and double check that you have 
followed all of the steps above.
