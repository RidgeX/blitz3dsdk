This file contains the actual Blitz3DSDK code, and should be copied either into the windows/system32
folder, or into the same folder as your application's executable.

The <a href=bbbeginblitz3d.html>bbBeginBlitz3D</a> command is the only command that is required
for use of the Blitz3DSDK.

Advanced commands are provided for lower level control of the 
Blitz3DSDK runtime that allow pre configuration of the system
with an application supplied parent window, message and/or
error handlers.
